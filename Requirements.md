- R3.3 (Optional): Where user-defined templates are supplied, the system shall include template text and placeholders in the LLM prompts.
- R3.4 (Ubiquitous): The system shall log AI-generated messages for auditing and compliance.

# 4. Sending & Follow-up
- R4.1 (Event-driven): When the user confirms a campaign, the system shall queue and send emails through the configured email service (e.g., SendGrid).
- R4.2 (State-driven): While a lead remains in "No Response" status for a defined period, the system shall trigger an AI-generated follow-up sequence.
- R4.3 (Event-driven): When a lead responds, the system shall capture the reply event and update the lead's status accordingly.
- R4.4 (Ubiquitoius): Where a campaign is already active, the system shall allow new leads to be added to that campaign in real time.
- R4.5 (Ubiquitoius): Where a campaign is active, the system shall provide a mechanism for pausing or stopping it. Upon resuming, the system shall continue sending messages to any remaining or newly added leads, without duplicating messages already sent.
- R4.6 (Ubiquitous): The system shall allow the user to manually intervene in any lead interaction at any point, overriding or pausing the AI agent's automated messages.
- R4.7 (Ubiquitous): The system shall allow the user to cede control back to the AI agent at any time, enabling the agent to continue automated outreach and follow-up.
- R4.8 (Ubiquitous): The system shall maintain a unified conversation log of both AI-driven and user-driven messages, so that when control is ceded back to the agent, it has full context of the entire conversation history.

# 5. Lead Qualification & Scoring
- R5.1 (Ubiquitous): The system shall maintain a "Lead Score" for each record, reflecting engagement and qualification criteria.
- R5.2 (Event-driven): When new lead data is ingested or updated, the system shall recalculate lead scores.
- R5.3 (Event-driven): When a lead surpasses a predefined engagement threshold, the system shall automatically mark it as "Qualified" and alert the user.
- R5.4 (Optional): Where a CRM integration is active, the system shall push updated scores and statuses to the CRM.

# 6. Response Handling & Classification
- R6.1 (Event-driven): When an inbound response is received, the system shall classify it (e.g., Interested, Not Interested, Requires Follow-up) using an LLM or classifier.
- R6.2 (Optional): Where specific keywords or intent indicators occur, the system shall generate an immediate alert to the user for timely follow-up.
- R6.3 (Ubiquitous): The system shall log all communication history in a searchable format.

# 7. Analytics & Reporting
- R7.1 (State-driven): While a campaign is active, the system shall display real-time metrics (open, click, reply rates) on a dashboard.
- R7.2 (Event-driven): When a campaign concludes, the system shall generate a summary report (e.g., total sends, replies, conversions).
- R7.3 (Optional): Where a user requests it, the system shall provide a downloadable (CSV/PDF) performance report.

# 8. Security & Access Control
- R8.1 (Ubiquitous): The system shall require user authentication (e.g., email/password, OAuth) before granting access.
- R8.2 (Event-driven): When an unauthorized access attempt is detected, the system shall deny access and log the event.
- R8.3 (Ubiquitous): The system shall store and process all data using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., TLS for transit).

# 9. System Configuration & Administration
- R9.1 (Optional): Where multiple user roles exist, the system shall allow an admin to assign privileges (Manager, Sales Rep, etc.).
- R9.2 (Event-driven): When the user updates email or LLM credentials, the system shall validate and apply new configurations without downtime.
- R9.3 (Ubiquitous): The system shall log all critical admin operations (e.g., campaign creation, data import, configuration changes).

# 10. Deployment & Maintenance
- R10.1 (Ubiquitous): The system shall be deployable on standard cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
- R10.2 (Event-driven): When an LLM or email service is unreachable, the system shall log an error and notify the administrator.
- R10.3 (Optional): Where on-premise deployment is required, the system shall provide a containerized (Docker) version to run core components.

# 11. User Interface & Accessibility
- R11.1 (Ubiquitous): The system shall provide a web-based interface accessible from desktop browsers for core functionality (e.g., campaign creation, lead management, analytics).
- R11.2 (Optional): Where a mobile experience is required, the system shall provide a mobile-responsive web design or a native mobile application for iOS and Android with equivalent key features (e.g., viewing campaign status, responding to leads, basic reporting).

# 12. Product Context & Use-Case Definition
- R12.1 (Ubiquitous): The system shall provide a chat-based interface that allows the user (e.g., a startup owner) to describe their product, target markets, and use cases in natural language.
- R12.2 (Ubiquitous): The system shall persist the user-provided product context in a structured metadata format, ensuring it can be leveraged for lead discovery and outreach customization.
- R12.3 (Event-driven): When the user updates product context (e.g., clarifies product features, changes target industries) via the chat, the system shall refresh the corresponding metadata to reflect the latest information.
- R12.4 (Ubiquitous): The system shall maintain a unified conversation log (including both user-provided context and system responses) so the agent retains the full context of the user's product description and prior instructions.
- R12.5 (Optional): Where the system is integrated with external data sources or lead platforms, it shall suggest relevant industries or leads that align with the stored product context metadata.
- R12.6 (Ubiquitous): The system shall update lead search and filtering criteria based on changes to the product context, ensuring newly discovered or qualified leads reflect the most up-to-date metadata.
