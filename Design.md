Front-End: A web application (responsive for mobile) or optionally a minimal native mobile app.
Back-End: Central orchestration with multiple modules, connected to external services (LLM provider, email service, CRM, etc.).
Database: Holds lead data, campaign data, conversation logs, product context metadata, etc. May include a vector store if you want advanced semantic search.
This layout allows easy swapping of LLM providers, minimal code changes for integrations, and a separation of concerns that keeps the system extensible.

2. Modules and Their Responsibilities
2.1 User Interface (UI) Module
Purpose: Provide a simple, intuitive interface for users to manage leads, create campaigns, view analytics, and converse with the system about their product context.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R2.1, R3.2, R7.1–7.3, R11.1–11.2 (User interacts with lead data, campaigns, analytics, and potential mobile access).
R12.1, R12.3 (Chat-based product context updates).
Features:
Dashboard: Overview of campaigns (active/paused/completed), number of leads, performance metrics.
Campaign Management: Wizard or simple form to create campaigns (define subject, personalization, follow-up intervals).
Lead View: Table/list of leads with status indicators (“Not Contacted,” “Contacted,” “No Response,” “Qualified,” etc.).
Chat Interface for Product Context: The user can type product details, target industries, or use cases; system clarifies or asks follow-up questions.
Manual Override: For a specific lead, the user can take over the conversation, see the entire communication log, and then later cede control back to the AI.
Responsive Design: Accessible from mobile browsers or optionally delivered as a minimal native app with the same core features.
Implementation Tip:

Use a low-code or no-code platform (e.g., Bubble, Retool) if needed to reduce dev costs. Or a minimal React/Next.js front end if you have in-house skill.
2.2 Authentication & Access Control
Purpose: Ensure only authorized users and roles can access and configure the system.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R8.1–8.3, plus part of R9.1.
Features:
User Accounts: Stored in a secure database table, hashed passwords or OAuth tokens.
Roles & Permissions: (Optional for MVP) “Admin,” “Manager,” “Sales Rep” with different views or edit rights.
Session Management: JWT tokens or session cookies.
Audit Log: Tracks key operations like user creation, campaign creation, data imports.
Implementation Tip:

Use an open-source library or a third-party service (Auth0, Firebase Auth) to keep cost and complexity low.
2.3 LLM Manager
Purpose: Provide a pluggable way to talk to different LLM providers for tasks like message generation, classification, summarization, etc.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R1.1–1.4, also relevant to R3.1, R3.3, R5.1, R6.1, R12.1.
Features:
Provider Configuration: Environment variables or database-stored credentials for each LLM.
Task Routing: Depending on the request type (email generation, sentiment classification, product context Q&A), route to the appropriate LLM.
Prompt Engineering: Predefined prompt templates or chain-of-thought flows. E.g., a standard prompt for outreach vs. a summarization prompt for replies.
LLM Swap: If you switch from OpenAI to Cohere, only environment configs or minimal code references need to change—no major refactoring.
Message Logging: Capture request/response in logs for debugging or audits (subject to data privacy constraints).
Implementation Tip:

Use a library like LangChain (Python/JS) for modular prompt management and easy switching among LLM backends.
2.4 Data & Campaign Manager
Purpose: Orchestrate lead ingestion, store campaign definitions, track statuses for each lead.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R2.1–2.4, R3.1–3.3, R4.4, R5.1–5.4, R9.2, plus synergy with R4.6–4.8 (takeover/ceding control).
Features:
Lead Ingestion: Parse CSV uploads (or fetch from CRM APIs), store leads with unique IDs, statuses, metadata.
Campaign Creation: Save user’s selected leads, message templates, follow-up rules, LLM prompt configurations.
Real-Time Updates: If new leads are added or campaigns are paused/resumed, update statuses.
Takeover/Cede Control: Mark a lead as “manual override” or “agent automation,” so the outreach module knows whether to keep sending automated messages or wait for user input.
Synchronization: If a CRM integration is active, push/pull updates on lead statuses, scores, etc.
Implementation Tip:

A PostgreSQL or MySQL database can store leads, campaign data, and statuses. For advanced searching or classification, a vector database (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) can be used, though it’s optional if cost is a concern.
2.5 Outreach Engine & Follow-Up
Purpose: Coordinate email sending, schedule follow-ups, and maintain a timeline of interactions.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R4.1–4.3, R4.4, R4.5 (adding leads mid-campaign, pause/resume), plus synergy with user override requirements (R4.6–4.8).
Features:
Email Scheduling: Calls an email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) to send messages in batches to avoid spam flags.
Follow-Up Logic: If no reply within N days, generate next follow-up message via LLM and schedule it.
Continuous Campaign: The engine monitors each lead’s state (no response, responded, unsubscribed) and triggers actions accordingly.
Manual Control: If a lead is flagged for manual handling, the engine stops automated messages and logs the lead as “pending user response.”
Implementation Tip:

Use a background job scheduler (e.g., Celery in Python, BullMQ in Node.js) to handle timed follow-ups and reduce load from the main request/response cycle.
2.6 Scoring & Classification
Purpose: Assign and update lead scores, classify email replies by sentiment or interest level.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R5.1–5.4, also R6.1–6.3 for response classification.
Features:
Lead Scoring: Weighted factors (job title, engagement, product fit) plus AI-based or rule-based scoring.
Reply Classification: Use an LLM or standard NLP model to determine if a reply is “Interested,” “Not Interested,” “Requires Follow-up,” etc.
Threshold Notifications: If a lead’s score surpasses a threshold, mark them as “Qualified” and optionally send an alert.
CRM Sync: If configured, push updated scores and statuses to CRM in real time.
Implementation Tip:

For simpler scoring, start with rule-based weights. Then optionally add an LLM or a classification model if the budget allows more advanced analysis.
2.7 Analytics & Reporting
Purpose: Present real-time insights, track campaign performance, allow exporting of data.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R7.1–7.3, R7.4 (show who’s been contacted, statuses, etc.).
Features:
Dashboard Metrics: Open rates, click-through rates (CTR), reply rates, conversion metrics at a campaign or lead level.
Lead-Level Detail: Which leads were contacted, current status, when follow-up is scheduled, manual vs. automated interactions.
Exports: CSV/PDF report for deeper analysis or sharing.
End-of-Campaign Summary: Summaries of key stats once a campaign concludes.
Implementation Tip:

Provide drill-down views so a user can see a high-level campaign success metric, then expand to see each lead’s history.
2.8 Security & Access Control
Purpose: Enforce secure handling of data, user authentication, and permission-based actions.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R8.1–8.3, plus relevant security concerns for LLM credentials (R1.4).
Features:
Encrypted Data: Use SSL/TLS for data in transit, encrypt lead data at rest if required by compliance.
Role-Based Access: Admins manage system settings, while Sales Reps can only operate within assigned campaigns.
Audit Logs: Track user sign-ins, data imports, campaign changes.
Implementation Tip:

Minimally, handle password hashing (BCrypt/Argon2) and secure session management.
Store LLM API keys securely in environment variables or a secrets manager.
2.9 Admin & Configuration
Purpose: Central place to manage LLM provider settings, email credentials, CRM integrations, and basic system behaviors.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R1.2 (changing LLM), R9.1–9.3, R10.2–10.3.
Features:
LLM Switch: Admin can choose “OpenAI” vs. “Cohere,” adjust prompts or temperature settings, and save.
Email Service Config: Enter SMTP or API keys for SendGrid/Mailgun.
CRM API Connectors: Manage tokens for Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.
Deployment & On-Prem: If on-prem is needed, store container configurations here.
Implementation Tip:

Keep the Admin UI minimal yet flexible. Possibly behind a separate route or role-based permission set.
2.10 Deployment & Maintenance
Purpose: Provide a blueprint for hosting, scaling, and ongoing operations.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R10.1–10.3 (cloud deployment, error handling, optional on-prem).
Plan:
Cloud Hosting: Use a single VPS or a managed container service (AWS ECS/Fargate, Heroku, Render.com, etc.) to keep operational overhead low.
Scaling Strategy: If usage grows, scale horizontally by adding more containers for the back-end, possibly a read-replica for the database.
Monitoring & Alerts: Basic metrics (CPU, memory, request volume), plus logs for email sending errors or LLM connectivity.
On-Prem Option: Provide a Docker Compose or Kubernetes YAML for customers who need in-house hosting.
2.11 Product Context & Use-Case Definition
Purpose: Let the user chat with the system to define their product, target markets, and have the system store it as metadata for lead discovery.
Key Requirements Addressed:
R12.1–12.6 (Chat-based context, metadata storage, applying context to lead search).
Features:
Chat-based Flow: The user can type product details. The system may ask clarifying questions (e.g., “Which industries are you focusing on?”).
Metadata Storage: The system persists these details in a structured form.
Lead Discovery: If integrated with external lead sources, the system uses the context to filter or rank potential leads.
Continuous Updates: If the user changes details, the system re-generates or updates recommended leads, updating any relevant campaign settings accordingly.
Implementation Tip:

Keep the chat logic simple at first. Let the LLM summarize the user’s statements into a “Product Context” record in the database.
For advanced domain-specific expansions, consider a vector store approach.
3. Sample Workflows
Below are brief outlines of how various workflows would play out, tying all modules together:

3.1 Creating a New Campaign & Adding Leads
User logs in (UI + Auth).
User navigates to “Create Campaign,” uploads CSV of leads (Data & Campaign Manager).
System normalizes lead data, stores in DB.
User configures subject line, message tone, follow-up intervals; System calls LLM Manager to generate sample outreach text.
User previews the text (UI) and clicks “Launch Campaign.”
Outreach Engine schedules the initial emails via SendGrid.
System monitors open/reply status and triggers follow-ups.
At any time, the user can add more leads or pause the campaign.
3.2 Manual Takeover & Return to AI
A lead replies with interest.
Scoring & Classification marks them as “Interested,” notifies the user.
The user goes into the conversation log, sees the prior messages, clicks “Take Over.”
The user writes a custom message. The agent no longer sends auto-responses.
Later, the user cedes control back to the AI, which now sees the entire conversation and can continue follow-ups.
3.3 Updating Product Context
User opens the “Product Context Chat” and inputs new details about a pivot to a different industry.
LLM Manager summarizes user statements and updates product metadata in DB.
Data & Campaign Manager references updated metadata for new lead searches or updated messaging.
Future campaigns automatically reflect the new target industry or product positioning.
3.4 Generating Analytics & Reports
System aggregates open/reply/conversion data over time.
Analytics & Reporting module displays real-time metrics on the dashboard, plus lead-by-lead breakdown.
User exports CSV/PDF if needed (compliance, offline analysis).
4. Cost and Simplicity Considerations
Hosting: Use a single cloud instance (e.g., AWS Lightsail, DigitalOcean droplet) or a managed service like Heroku/Render to minimize DevOps overhead (~$50–$100/month).
LLM API: Pay-as-you-go usage (OpenAI, Cohere) means you only pay for actual tokens used. Starting cost can be quite low, scaling up with usage.
Email Service: Free tier or minimal monthly cost for smaller volumes.
Development: Keep modules in a single codebase with a well-structured directory. Strict microservices might be overkill for an MVP.
Optional Components:
Vector store: only if advanced semantic lead searches are needed.
Native mobile apps: can be deferred in favor of a responsive web app to stay under budget.
5. Extensibility
Modular Code Structure: Each module (LLM Manager, Outreach Engine, etc.) can be updated independently without breaking the entire system.
Provider Switch: Changing the LLM or email service is a matter of updating config credentials or endpoints.
Add New Features: Additional modules (e.g., advanced sentiment analysis, multi-lingual outreach) can be integrated with minimal refactoring if you maintain clear interfaces.
Scalability: Start small (one server, single DB), then move to containers/kubernetes if user load grows.
Conclusion
This design meets all the EARS requirements—including optional ones like multi-provider LLM, manual override, dynamic lead additions, and product context chat—while staying simple and budget-friendly. The module-based approach ensures maintainability, and a single or minimal set of services approach keeps infrastructure cost under control. Over time, you can iteratively enhance each module (e.g., deeper CRM integrations, more sophisticated analytics) without having to overhaul the entire system.
